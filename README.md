# Data Science Core Independent Project Week 8

## __Classification on a Health Dataset__ ##


## _Description_ ##

A Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. The data was to be then used to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.


## _Platforms Used_ ##
* Google Colab
* Git/GitHub


## _Technologies Used_ ##
* Python
* Pandas Library
* Numpy Library
* Matplotlib Library
* Seaborn Library
* Standard Library
* SciPy Library
* Sci-Kit Library
* xgboost
* catboost

## _Motivation_ ##
The aim was to try and come up with an accurate and also precise model to classify if a patient had hypothyroid or not. Given the burden that the healthcare sector faces in terms of under-staffing and also long working hours, it would be of immense help if some of the load was reduced such as a form of pre-screening before needing the doctors to step in. Resulting in freeing up resources to focus on urgent and life threatening cases. For the model, Decision Trees(Random Trees, AdaBoosted and XGBoosted trees) were all tested including SVM to get the best performing one.
